            My name is Sofia and I am currently studying at Hyper Island to be a frontend developer. I have a background in the fine art and crafts and I am a textile artist. I also have long work experience with customer service from working at two culture instittutions in Stockholm. 
            <br/>
            The interest for code began when I stumbled upon a free introduction course in JavaScript only two years ago and after that I was hooked. 
            <br/>
            With a mentality that it is important to continue to learn thru your whole life, a passion for creativity and problem solving as well as having a interest in teambuilding and dynamics, I felt that I hit home when starting this journey on Hyper Island.
            <br/>
            I am intrigued by tech companies and projects that works with the human in mind and that have a social consciousness.
